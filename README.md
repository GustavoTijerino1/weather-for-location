# weather-for-location

## Task
I created a Weather app , by using HTML, CSS and JS. I used various functions and global variables to make the app functional. I also used EventListeners to activate some functions by a click of a button. I grabbed all the information of the city's weather from the API.

I used some of my old work and these websites for more information:

 I also had help from my classmates and my Tutor Zachary Auerbach.
